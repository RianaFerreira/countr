# countr
This application allows a user to setup an entitlement milestone i.e. Citizenship. 
The stays in the country can be captured for each user's entitlement. 
The stays are then used to calculate the time remaining before the milestone has been achieved.

Playing with countr allowing me to use:
* simple forms
* strong params
* nested attributes
* coffee script
* javascript
* turbolinks

TO DO:
* Fix the adding of additional stays when editing a user.
* Displaying the count down for a selected user.
